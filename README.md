EcoLocation's Repository for HPC Hackathon 2022


EcoLocation website aims to connect organizations, officials, educators, and people looking to enter career fields related to supporting environmental efforts in order to provide funding, education, and growth in those fields.

By combining the following technologies below.


Langages we use Node js, Express js, and XAMPP as well as the structure of a mySQL and PHP connection.
Our website is being hosted via a Linux virtual machine on Google Cloud.


We provide a platform through which organizations supporting environment efforts are able to easily promote their efforts and events, as well as providing those working in or entering into these career fields with a direct line of connection to organizations and educators who can support them.
